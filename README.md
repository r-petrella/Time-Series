# Time-Series

Here there are some codes written by me during the course of Time Series

Covered topics: linear time series analysis (linear processes, Wold representation, autocovariance and spectral density function, inference on the moments of a linear process) and basic stochastic processes (conditioning, martingales, martingale difference sequences).

Time varying parameter models. Parameter driven models: state space models and the Kalman filter. Observation driven models:  GARCH processes and Score driven models. Estimation and inference.
